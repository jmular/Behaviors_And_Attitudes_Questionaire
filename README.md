# Youthful Offenders Program 
UNDER CONSTRUCTION: THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE AS I UPLOAD OUR SET UP



The Youthful Offenders Program is an alcohol and drug education program for persons cited for underage drinking, and similar offenses, in Centre County (PA). 
  Developed by Centre Helps and approved by local District Judges, the program offers offenders an alternative to the standard fine and the permanent criminal record carried by underage drinking.
  Centre Helps' Youthful Offenders Program is designed to increase self-awareness and monitoring skills as they relate to alcohol and substance use and abuse. 
  All classes are conducted in a nonjudgmental, supportive environment. Participants pay a registration fee to Centre Helps in place of a more expensive court fine. 
  Upon completion of the educational program, the citation is changed to a dismissed disposition.
